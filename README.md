# ShnooTalk Playground (Svelte Version)

Run and try the [ShnooTalk](https://github.com/RainingComputers/ShnooTalk) language from your browser!

Web code editor for ShnooTalk Cloud Compile based on [shnootalk-ace](https://github.com/RainingComputers/shnootalk-ace/pulse)
(extended [ace](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace) text editor with ShnooTalk syntax support).

ShnooTalk playground uses the [Shnootalk Cloud Compile](https://github.com/RainingComputers/shnootalk-cloud-compile/) project for backend.

This is rewrite of the original [ShnooTalk Playground](https://github.com/RainingComputers/shnootalk-playground) in svelte
